## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! Iâ€™m an AR/VR developer working with Unity and Vuforia to create immersive augmented and virtual reality experiences. This repository showcases my work in developing interactive AR/VR applications, focusing on object recognition, spatial awareness, and real-time 3D rendering. Whether youâ€™re just starting out in AR/VR development or looking for advanced techniques, youâ€™ll find valuable resources and projects here to help you bring your immersive experiences to life.

A key aspect of my work is object recognition using Vuforia. By leveraging its powerful image recognition and tracking capabilities, I create applications that can detect and interact with physical objects in the real world. From marker-based tracking to model targets, I build systems that allow virtual objects to seamlessly overlay the real environment, enabling engaging and interactive experiences. This approach is ideal for applications like product visualizations, games, and interactive education.

Spatial awareness is another critical element in AR/VR applications. I use Unity's physics engine and Vuforiaâ€™s advanced tracking features to ensure that virtual objects are accurately placed within the user's environment. By incorporating techniques like environment mapping and depth sensing, I create experiences where virtual content feels anchored to the real world, enhancing realism and interactivity.

Real-time 3D rendering is central to delivering fluid, high-quality AR/VR experiences. I optimize rendering pipelines in Unity to ensure smooth performance across different devices, from mobile AR to high-end VR headsets. This includes optimizing assets, managing lighting, and implementing advanced shaders to create visually stunning environments that respond to user input in real-time.

Feel free to explore my projects, fork them, or contribute. I hope you find inspiration and tools to create your own immersive AR/VR applications. Thanks for checking out my work!
